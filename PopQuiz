Certainly! Below, I'll provide you with Terraform scripts to set up the infrastructure for development components, including ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for storing Docker images and AWS Batch for managing batch jobs. Additionally, I'll include steps to deploy code from GitHub to ECR using GitHub Actions.

Terraform Script for Development Infrastructure
Step 1: Create main.tf for AWS Resources
Create a main.tf file in your Terraform directory (e.g., terraform/development/main.tf):


provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Replace with your preferred AWS region
}

# Create Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "my_ecr_repo" {
  name = "my-ecr-repo"  # Replace with your ECR repository name
  tags = {
    Environment = "Development"
  }
}

# Create AWS Batch Compute Environment
resource "aws_batch_compute_environment" "my_batch_env" {
  compute_environment_name = "my-batch-env"  # Replace with your compute environment name
  type                     = "MANAGED"
  compute_resources {
    type        = "EC2"
    min_vcpus   = 0
    max_vcpus   = 64
    instance_types = ["optimal"]
    instance_role = aws_iam_role.my_batch_role.arn
    subnets      = ["subnet-12345678", "subnet-87654321"]  # Replace with your subnet IDs
  }
}

# IAM Role for AWS Batch
resource "aws_iam_role" "my_batch_role" {
  name               = "my-batch-role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Effect    = "Allow",
      Principal = {
        Service = "batch.amazonaws.com"
      },
      Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
    }]
  })

  # Attach policies as needed
  managed_policy_arns = [
    "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSBatchServiceRole"
  ]
}

# Example: CodePipeline or CodeDeploy for continuous deployment from GitHub to ECR
# Replace with your specific GitHub repository and access token
resource "aws_codepipeline" "my_codepipeline" {
  name     = "my-codepipeline"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.my_codepipeline_role.arn

  artifact_store {
    location = aws_s3_bucket.my_artifacts.bucket
    type     = "S3"
  }

  stage {
    name = "Source"
    action {
      name             = "Source"
      category         = "Source"
      owner            = "ThirdParty"
      provider         = "GitHub"
      version          = "1"
      output_artifacts = ["source_output"]

      configuration = {
        Owner          = "your_github_username"
        Repo           = "your_github_repo"
        Branch         = "main"
        OAuthToken     = "your_github_oauth_token"
        PollForSourceChanges = "false"
      }
    }
  }

  stage {
    name = "Build"
    action {
      name             = "Build"
      category         = "Build"

      input_artifacts  = ["source_output"]
      output_artifacts = ["build_output"]

      configuration = {
        ProjectName = "your_codebuild_project_name"
      }
    }
  }

  stage {
    name = "Deploy"
    action {
      name             = "Deploy"
      category         = "Deploy"
      owner            = "AWS"
      provider         = "CodeDeployToECS"
      version          = "1"
      input_artifacts  = ["build_output"]
      
      configuration = {
        ApplicationName          = "your_code_deploy_application_name"
        DeploymentGroupName      = "your_code_deploy_deployment_group_name"
        Image1ArtifactName       = "build_output"
        Image1ContainerName      = "your_container_name"

Setting up a four-stage CI/CD pipeline with Terraform for infrastructure, using either GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automation, and integrating SonarQube for code quality checks involves several steps. Here’s a high-level outline of how you can achieve this:

1. Define the CI/CD Pipeline Stages:
Stage 1: Development (Dev)

Purpose: Build and test changes in a development environment.
Actions:
Checkout source code from GitHub repository.
Build the application (e.g., compile code, package artifacts).
Run unit tests.
Optionally, run static code analysis (e.g., SonarQube scans).
Deploy to a development environment using Terraform.

Stage 2: Quality Assurance (QA)

Purpose: Test changes in an environment closer to production.
Actions:
Deploy to QA environment using Terraform.
Run integration tests.
Perform additional quality checks (e.g., performance testing, security scans).
Trigger manual approval step.
Stage 3: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Purpose: Allow stakeholders to validate changes in a production-like environment.
Actions:
Deploy to UAT environment using Terraform.
Conduct user acceptance tests.
Trigger manual approval step.
Stage 4: Production (Prod)

Purpose: Deploy changes to production after all tests and approvals are complete.
Actions:
Deploy to production environment using Terraform.
Perform final checks (e.g., smoke tests, monitoring configuration).
Trigger manual approval step.

2. Setup Infrastructure with Terraform:
Define Terraform configurations (*.tf files) for each environment (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod).
Store Terraform state securely (e.g., using remote state in AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
Use Terraform workspaces or variables to differentiate between environments.

3. Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Jenkins:
GitHub Actions:

Create a .github/workflows directory in your GitHub repository.
Define YAML files for each stage (dev.yml, qa.yml, uat.yml, prod.yml).
Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials).
Integrate steps to checkout code, run tests, deploy using Terraform, and trigger manual approvals where necessary.
Jenkins:

Install Jenkins and necessary plugins (e.g., Pipeline, Terraform).
Create a pipeline job for each stage (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod).
Define pipelines using Jenkinsfile or through Jenkins UI.
Configure stages, steps, and manual approvals using Jenkins pipeline syntax.
Use credentials plugin to manage secrets securely.

4. Integrate SonarQube for Code Quality (Optional):
Configure SonarQube server and obtain access token.
Integrate SonarQube with your CI/CD pipeline:
Add SonarQube scanner to your build steps in GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
Analyze code quality metrics (e.g., code coverage, code smells, security vulnerabilities).
Fail builds based on defined quality gates in SonarQube (optional but recommended).
5. Manual Approvals:
Implement manual approval steps between stages in your CI/CD pipeline:
Use GitHub Actions' jobs.<job_id>.needs and jobs.<job_id>.steps.<step_id>.if features to require manual approval.
In Jenkins, use input step to pause pipeline execution and wait for manual approval.

6. Pipeline Orchestration:
Ensure proper error handling and rollback mechanisms in case of deployment failures.
Use notifications (e.g., Slack, Email) to alert stakeholders about pipeline status changes.
Monitor pipeline performance and adjust stages as necessary based on feedback.
By following these steps, you can create a robust CI/CD pipeline with Terraform for infrastructure management, GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automation, and optionally integrate SonarQube for enhanced code quality checks, with manual approvals between each stage (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod).

To set up a four-stage CI/CD pipeline using Terraform for infrastructure, GitHub Actions for automation, and optionally integrating SonarQube for code quality checks, while adhering to the constraints of using free AWS services for testing, here’s a step-by-step guide along with deployment steps in a README file format:

Deployment Steps for CI/CD Pipeline
Prerequisites
GitHub Repository: Ensure you have a GitHub repository containing your application code.
AWS Account: Sign up for an AWS account if you haven’t already. Make sure to use free tier services to avoid costs.
Setting Up Terraform for Infrastructure
Install Terraform:

Download and install Terraform from terraform.io.
Verify installation by running terraform --version.
Configure AWS Credentials:

Create an IAM user in your AWS account with programmatic access.
Attach AdministratorAccess policy (for testing purposes only).
Obtain Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
bash
Copy code
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-1  # Or your preferred region
Default output format [None]: json
Create Terraform Configuration Files:

Create .tf files for each environment (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod) in a directory structure (e.g., terraform/dev/main.tf, terraform/qa/main.tf, etc.).
Example (main.tf for Dev environment):

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
Initialize and Apply Terraform:

Initialize Terraform in each environment directory.
bash
Copy code
$ cd terraform/dev
$ terraform init
Apply the Terraform configuration to create infrastructure.
bash
Copy code
$ terraform apply
# Type 'yes' to confirm
Repeat init and apply steps for each environment (QA, UAT, Prod).
Setting Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
Create GitHub Actions Workflow:

Inside your GitHub repository, create a .github/workflows directory.
Create YAML files (dev.yml, qa.yml, uat.yml, prod.yml) for each environment.
Example (dev.yml):


name: CI/CD Pipeline - Dev

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Terraform
        run: |
          terraform init
          terraform apply -auto-approve

      # Add steps for build, test, and optional SonarQube integration

Integrate SonarQube (Optional):

Obtain SonarQube server URL and access token.
Add SonarQube scanner steps in your GitHub Actions workflow YAML files to analyze code quality.
Configure Manual Approvals:

Use GitHub Actions' workflow dispatch event or manual approval mechanism to trigger manual approval steps between stages.
README File Example
Create a README.md file in your repository with the following structure:
